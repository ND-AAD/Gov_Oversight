- [üìã Work Plan & Progress](../WORK_PLAN.md)
- [üíª GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ND-AAD/Gov_Oversight)

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Foundation & Core Backend (Phase 1)
**Progress:** Item 1.1 Complete ‚úÖ | Working on Items 1.2-1.5

## What This Tool Does

This scraper monitors government websites for Request for Proposals (RFPs) related to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, with particular focus on:

- üïµÔ∏è **Surveillance Infrastructure** - Security systems, monitoring equipment
- üèóÔ∏è **Construction Contracts** - Olympic venues, infrastructure projects  
- üö® **Security Services** - Policing, crowd control, emergency response
- üìä **Data Systems** - Databases, analytics platforms, citizen tracking

## Why This Matters

The 2028 Olympics provide cover for expanding government surveillance capabilities. By tracking RFPs in real-time, citizens can:

- Identify concerning contracts before they're awarded
- Organize public opposition to problematic procurement
- Ensure public debate about surveillance expansion
- Hold officials accountable for transparency promises

## Architecture Overview

### Location-Binding Technology
Instead of fragile CSS selectors, our scraper learns from examples:
1. User provides sample data from government sites
2. Scraper identifies where that data appears
3. Future scraping extracts current values from those locations
4. Resilient to website design changes

### Transparency by Design
- **Public Code**: All scraping logic is open source
- **Public Data**: RFP data available at `/data/rfps.json`
- **Public Operations**: GitHub Actions show every scraping run
- **Public Issues**: Community can report problems or suggest improvements
